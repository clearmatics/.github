# Clearmatics

## About us

Clearmatics is a technology and protocol engineering company 🤖.

We are building a new financial market architecture that is more open, fair, and resilient than the legacy systems that are in use today. We design protocols and write software that create new markets for risks and more efficient infrastructure for trading 📉📈.

We're driven by progress and continuous improvement.

## Feel like joining us?

We operate in a "remote first" model and are regularly looking to expend our global team 🗺️.

If you see yourself as a software engineer/protocol engineer/developer/computer scientist, have a "doer" mindset and are eager to design and implement robust distributed systems, state-of-the-art cryptography and incentive structures, we probably have a role for you on our [hiring board](https://boards.greenhouse.io/clearmatics)!

## Contributing

We are always happy to receive contributions in any form (e.g. code, docs, feature requests, feedback etc.) on our various open source projects. So, if you feel like contributing, you are very welcomed to do so! 🙌.
